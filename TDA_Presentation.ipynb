For each $x_i, x_j \\in X$ the distance $\\delta_k(x_i, x_j)$ is defined by the minimal number of edges between the in the k-nearest neighbour graph. This has the effect of normalizing distances across layers in neural networks, while preserving connectivity of nearest neighbors. This is desirable, because the layers will change geometry quite drastically and this metric is rather robust to geometric changes, but will still reveal the topological ones, that we are looking for."
